# Creating Adapters

## Choose The Adapter Type

- Create a provider override adapter when auth, transport, or catalog behavior is specific to one `providerID`.
- Create a generic npm adapter when many providers share the same SDK package behavior.
- Provider overrides win over npm adapters during resolution.

## Required Shape

- `key`
- `displayName`
- `match`
- `listAuthMethods(): Effect.Effect<AnyAuthMethodDefinition[], RuntimeRpcError>`
- `createModel(): Effect.Effect<LanguageModelV3, RuntimeRpcError>`

Optional:

- `patchCatalog(): Effect.Effect<ProviderInfo | void, RuntimeRpcError>` to alter provider/model metadata before it is stored

## Schema Rules

- Use Effect Schema for serializable auth/config inputs.
- Use `defineAuthSchema()` and return that schema from each auth method.
- Do not model runtime-only values like `fetch`, browser tabs, or callback handlers in schemas.
- Use Effect Schema to validate successful `response.json()` payloads from OAuth and provider APIs instead of `as SomeResponse` casts.

## Auth Persistence

- Auth is always stored by `providerID`.
- Adapters receive the normalized runtime auth record directly through `ctx.auth`.
- Auth methods must return `Effect`, not `Promise`.
- Adapters should parse only the provider-specific metadata they need locally, close to use.
- Adapters may refresh tokens and persist updated auth during `createModel()`.
- OAuth/device/browser flows should return a normalized `AuthResult`.
- `ctx.oauth.launchWebAuthFlow`, `ctx.authFlow.publish`, and `context.authStore.get/set/remove` are all Effect-returning helpers.

## Execution Boundary

- `createModel()` owns the final execution configuration: base URL, auth headers, API keys, custom `fetch`, and request wrappers.
- The shared runtime passes resolved provider/model records, request metadata, the stored auth snapshot, auth-store helpers, and a runtime clock helper into `createModel()`.
- Keep adapter logic Effect-native all the way to the AI SDK boundary. Only `LanguageModelV3.doGenerate()` / `doStream()` should cross back into Promise-returning APIs.
- Re-read auth from the injected `authStore` helpers only when refresh or coordination requires it.
- Persisted auth metadata should be JSON-compatible and typed per adapter.
- Do not reintroduce a shared transport/session abstraction for provider-specific request behavior.

## Browser Constraints

- If an SDK package is not browser-safe, make that explicit in `createModel()`.
- Keep custom transport behavior local to the adapter.
- Avoid introducing generic request-mutation pipelines in the shared runtime.

## Examples

- Generic adapter: npm package plus API key auth, then parse provider options inside `Effect.gen(...)` in `createModel()` and build the SDK client directly.
- Provider override adapter: provider-specific auth plus optional `patchCatalog()` and a wrapped `LanguageModelV3` from `createModel()`, using `Effect.gen(...)` for refresh flows and auth persistence.
